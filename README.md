# Causal Tick Suppression Theory

> **A foundational physics theory replacing spacetime geometry with causal energy flow and tick-rate modulation.**

## 🧠 Overview

This repository presents the full formulation of the **Causal Tick Suppression (CTS)** theory, a first-principles physical framework in which relativistic effects emerge from the dynamics of internal causal transformations (tick rates), not from the geometry of spacetime.

In CTS, both time dilation and gravitational effects arise from **suppression of a system’s intrinsic transformation rate** due to energy diversion caused by motion and gravitational binding. The theory replaces the geometric foundation of Special and General Relativity with a mechanistic model grounded in causal energy redistribution.

This is not a reformulation of SR/GR but a **physics-first alternative** that derives the same predictions from a different ontology: energy acts through space to update causal states and time emerges as a secondary effect.

## 📜 Key Results

- ✅ Derivation of the **Lorentz factor** from the causal postulate E_k = mad
- ✅ Gravitational redshift from internal energy binding via Φ(x)
- ✅ Unified tick dilation formula:  R_eff = (mc² / h) × [1 / (ad / c² + 1)] × √(1 + 2Φ / c²)
- ✅ Causal reinterpretation of **light bending** via refractive index: n(r) = 1 / √(1 - 2GM / (r·c²))
