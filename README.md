# Causal Tick Suppression Theory

> **A foundational physics theory replacing spacetime geometry with causal energy flow and tick-rate modulation.**

---

## 🧠 Overview

This repository presents the full formulation of the **Causal Tick Suppression (CTS)** theory — a first-principles physics framework in which relativistic effects arise from the modulation of internal causal transformation rates (*tick rates*), not from the geometry of spacetime.

In CTS, both time dilation and gravitational phenomena emerge from **suppression of a system’s intrinsic causal update rate**, caused by energy diversion due to motion and gravitational binding. The theory replaces the geometric foundation of Special and General Relativity with a mechanistic model grounded in causal energy redistribution.

This is not a reformulation of SR or GR, but a **physics-first alternative** that reproduces their predictions through a fundamentally different ontology: energy acts through space to update causal states — and time emerges as a secondary effect.

## 📜 Key Results

- ✅ Derivation of the **Lorentz factor** from the causal postulate E_k = mad
- ✅ Gravitational redshift from internal energy binding via Φ(x)
- ✅ Unified tick dilation formula:  R_eff = (mc² / h) × [1 / (ad / c² + 1)] × √(1 + 2Φ / c²)
- ✅ Causal reinterpretation of **light bending** via refractive index: n(r) = 1 / √(1 - 2GM / (r·c²))
